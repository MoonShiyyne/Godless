# Godless build order

Derived from the design doc (rev 7) and the build-order registry (v1, rev 5).
Full stage plan, with the reasoning and the gate failure actions:
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/0bcf773e-22cb-4314-b8a1-8e290edfe63b

The design doc is the source of truth. This file is derived. When they
disagree, the doc wins and this file gets re-synced.

## Current position

Stage 0 (repo setup): **done**. S00, S01, S02, S03, S04, S05, S08: **done**.

**Write voxels through `VoxelWorld.Set`, which requires a cause.**
`ChunkStore.SetRaw` records nothing and exists only for worldgen and save
restore. That is L3, and it is the one thing in this stratum that cannot be
fixed later.

Next: **S09** (island generator, biomes, material deposit fields). It is the
last big non-Editor piece of stratum 0, G1's first test is "change the biome
and see whether the architecture changes", and S10/S11/S15/S16 all depend on
it. Then S0B (water), S0A (constants), S0C (save/load).

Measured: the harness runs **60,000 simulated years in 0.19s** — about
318,000 sim-years/sec on an empty world. `sim verify` is proven to catch a
system that reads the wall clock.

S06/S07 need a reachable Editor and are the only stratum-0 systems that do.
`unity status` currently reports no connected Editor, so they are the natural
work for a session with Unity open. Runbook step B4 is also still unverified
there: the grep guard is proven to catch a Unity reference, but that the
asmdef itself refuses to compile one has not been confirmed in the Editor.

Nothing in stratum 1 may start until S00–S09 and S0A–S0C are green. Each is a
decision the rest of the codebase encodes rather than calls.

## Registry health warning

The registry is v1, derived from design doc **rev 5**, `sourceParts "01-23"`.
The doc is now **rev 7 with 27 parts** and the part numbering shifted.
**45 of 68 rows carry at least one wrong part number.** Match systems by their
`name` and `tell`, never by the `part` field, until the re-sync lands.

Three known defects to respect before the re-sync:

- **S63 is superseded.** Part 16 replaced grievance-threshold schism with
  schism as a failure mode of the quorum decision system (S3A). Building S63
  as registered produces exactly what rev 7 rejects.
- **S28 (harness) must move to stratum 0 as S08.** L7 requires an assertion in
  the harness from stratum 2 on, and the harness is *in* stratum 2 — so the
  first ten systems L7 governs cannot comply.
- **No worldgen row exists.** "biome" appears nowhere in the registry, yet
  G1's first test is "change the biome." S10, S11, S15 and S16 all depend on
  it. Registered in the stage plan as S09.

## Stratum 0 — Substrate (M0, ~4 units)

| ID | System | Deps |
|----|--------|------|
| S00 | Sim / Unity assembly split, plus CI guard | — |
| S01 | Fixed tick + seeded RNG streams | S00 |
| S02 | Content pipeline, base game as mods | S00 |
| S03 | Voxel chunk store, 512x512x160 | S00 |
| S04 | Voxel delta log + snapshots | S03, S01 |
| S05 | Annalist record schema | S01 |
| S06 | Binary greedy meshing + baked AO | S03 |
| S07 | Camera, input, terrain editing | S06 |
| S08 | Headless runner + assertion framework | S00, S01 |
| S09 | Island generator, biomes, material deposits | S03, S02 |
| S0A | Palette, module grid, material cap, contrast rule | S02 |
| S0B | Water table + flow accumulation | S03, S09 |
| S0C | Save / load serialization contract | S03, S04, S05 |

S00 is complete: the asmdef sets `noEngineReferences: true`, `Tools/check-laws.sh`
guards L1 and L2, and CI runs it.

**Exit (G0):** determinism test green (same seed, 300 years, byte-identical
annals); the guard fails a planted `using UnityEngine;`; deleting
`Assets/Content/base` still boots; the harness runs unattended.
**On failure: do not start stratum 1.**

S01's half of G0 is green: 300 simulated years digest-identical across runs,
and identical under a different stream registration order.

S02's half is green too: `WithoutTheBaseMod_ItStillBoots` loads a content
root with no base mod and gets zero mods, zero documents and no exception.

S05 gives "byte-identical annals" something to actually mean: `Annalist`
digests its whole record, so the G0 assertion becomes a digest comparison
once there are systems writing into it.

S03's tell is measured, not asserted: a full island surface costs **2 MB**
across 512 of 1280 chunks, against 160 MB for a naive int per voxel — 78x.
The budget test is set at 8 MB so that losing uniform-chunk elision fails
in CI rather than in a profiler.

S04 answers the simulation half of M0's exit condition already:
`RaiseAHill_ThenScrubBackToBeforeYouRaisedIt` raises a hill in year 12,
scrubs back to tick 0, finds the flat ground, and confirms the reconstructed
world digests identically to the original. What is missing from that scene is
the renderer, not the history.

S08 closes the harness half of G0: `sim verify` runs each seed twice and
compares byte for byte, and `sim run` checks every registered invariant
across 200 seeds and exits non-zero when one fails.

Remaining for G0: the hill-raise scene rendered at 60fps (S06, S07 — both
need an Editor).

## Numerics: decided

**`double` under guard-enforced discipline**, not fixed-point. Recorded in
CLAUDE.md under L2 and enforced by `Tools/check-laws.sh`.

The four basic operations and `Sqrt` are IEEE-754 correctly rounded and give
bit-identical results in CoreCLR, Mono and IL2CPP. Only the transcendentals
vary, because `System.Math` forwards those to the platform's libm — so those
are banned inside `Assets/Sim` and `Core.SimMath` reimplements them from
`+ - * /` and `Sqrt` alone, verified against `System.Math` to 1e-12.

Fixed-point was rejected as a tax on every gene value, utility score,
influence map and site weight in the game, for certainty the narrow ban
already buys.

## The open stratum-0 decision

**Fixed-point, or float under strict discipline, in the sim core.** Part 23
requires one or the other and the doc never calls it. G0's byte-identical
annals cannot hold across machines until it is decided.

It did **not** block S01 — the tick is a counter and the streams produce
integers, so `Assets/Sim/Core` is representation-agnostic and `RngStream`
deliberately exposes no `NextDouble`. It binds at **S03** (chunk and column
data), **S10** (influence maps) and **S17** (gene values) — the first systems
that store a continuous quantity. Decide before S03.

Recommendation: **double, under discipline enforced by the guard.** In .NET
the four basic operations and `Sqrt` are IEEE-754 correctly rounded and agree
across CoreCLR, Mono and IL2CPP; what varies is the transcendentals, because
those come from the platform's libm. So the discipline is narrow and
greppable — ban `Math.Sin/Cos/Tan/Pow/Exp/Log` in `Assets/Sim`, provide
deterministic replacements in `Core/SimMath`, and add the ban to
`Tools/check-laws.sh` in the same commit. Fixed-point buys a little more
certainty for a tax on every gene, score and field in the game, which is the
wrong trade for a solo build. Not yet decided — this is a recommendation.
